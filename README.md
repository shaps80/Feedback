            withFeedback(
                .haptic(.selection)

                )
            ) {
                // state change
            }

    @State private var toggle: Bool = false
    
    var body: some View {
        Toggle("Toggle", isOn: $toggle.feedback(.haptic(.selection)))
    }
}
```
